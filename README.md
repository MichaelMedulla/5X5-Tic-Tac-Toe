This program will display a 5X5 game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
The win conditions are set where a player has to get 5 in a row, column, or diagonally to win.
If all cells are filled, the game will be a draw and displayed as such.
X will start the game, and O follows after.
When one player wins, the game ends and clicks will no longer be registered.
